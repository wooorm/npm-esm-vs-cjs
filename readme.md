## What is this?

This repository contains (historical) data on [high-impact][] (popular) packages
and what kind of code they expose:

* ESM â€” such as `type: 'module'` in `package.json`
* Dual â€” such as both `import` and `require` conditions in export map
* Faux ESM â€” `module` field in `package.json`, supported by some old bundlers
* CJS â€” anything else (except for `@types/*`)

## When should I use this?

Use this data for rough insights on how the shift to ESM is progressing.
The data isnâ€™t perfect though.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: the crawl of `2024-05-27` adjusts several packages that were
> previously classified incorrectly as dual.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: crawls from before 2022-11-04 use the list of popular packages
> on the date of 2022-11-04, as I had the results of all packages, but not which
> of them were popular back then.
> Later dates will use a list of whatâ€™s popular on that date.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: not all of these packages are popular.
> There are some false-positives, such that download counts can be gamed, and
> that `libraries.io` sometimes thinks that a fork of webpack or so is actually
> webpack.

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: while `@types/*` packages are filtered out in the above counts,
> it is likely that there are other packages included that arenâ€™t really code,
> particularly in the CJS category (as thatâ€™s the default).

## Scripts

This repo includes scripts to crawl npm and analyze the results.
You need a `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable with a token to crawl npm.

[`script/crawl.js`][crawl] analyzes the `package.json` files of `latest`
releases of [high-impact][] npm packages.
This script finishes in about 5 minutes.
You should likely first contribute to `npm-high-impact`, which can take like
24 hours to complete.

[`script/analyze.js`][analyze] analyzes the data files and generates SVG and
CSV files from them.
After running that, please copy/paste the new `.csv` into this readme above.
